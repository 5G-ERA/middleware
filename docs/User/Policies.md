# Policies 

Semantic Policy: set of rules that will be followed to perform a given task. A policy is chosen at the very beginning by human manual setup. The policies are not optimal but rather represent heuristic approaches to solve the problem. Each policy has a trade-off and therefore the is never a right or wrong approach. Following are a set of rules established by the 5G Era middleware as examples:

1. Everything on the cloud/Edge: This policy describes that everything we run, will be executed and store in Cloud/Edge; we will avoid ROBOT for that action as much as we can. 

2. Historical data (local experience): choose the actor that performed best during past same operation/task.

3. Choose the machine closer to the robot.

Assumption: all edge machines are closer to the robot rather than the cloud machines. This is according to the definition of edge and cloud.
