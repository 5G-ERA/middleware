## Onboarding your 5G-ERA Middleware system:

By default, the middleware will have to be populated with your enviroment, robots and custom tasks for your experiments to be conducted. The topology for your cloud
system needs to be created for the resource planner to accurately plan best placement of the NetApp's and actions. The action planner would require the robot ROS specifications
as well as the locomotion system, sensors and other parameters. Therefore, before using the middleware, the onboarding process needs to be finished.
