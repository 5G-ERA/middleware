# System Architecture

System Architecture is the overall workflow of the middleware. The Middleware is the link between vertical applications managed by ROS and 5G infrastructure managed by OSM. The Gateway is the entry point into the Middleware system. It is responsible for handling the
incoming requests, by routing the traffic to the desired endpoints, retrieving the information
from the backend endpoints, and relaying it back to the robot.
